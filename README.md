# mongo-scraper
Bird's Eye is an application that scrapes data from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Fox News to give the user a "bird's eye view" of what's happening and how the media uses headlines to show their political bias. The user can click on any article to go to the website and comment on any article.

## Technologies Used

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Cheerio
* Materialize
* SASS

## Goals

This small web app was created to fulfill the requirements of the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp and demonstrates the ability to create a full stack web application using Mongoose and MongoDB. Another target of this assignment was to use Cheerio to scrape data from a website, save it to the database, and dynamically display it on a web page. Additionally Materialize and SASS were used as a personal goal to learn new font-end frameworks and to practice using SASS.

## Future Goals

* Create user login
* Allow users to save articles
* Don't allow duplicate articles to be saved in the database
* Scrape everytime the user requests articles
